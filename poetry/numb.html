                <p>
                    Here I stand, numb,<br>
                    Injured and broken.<br>
                    Stuck in this slum,<br>
                    Wishing I’d stayed unspoken.<br><br>

                    Still here I remain,<br>
                    Lost in the haze,<br>
                    The exit feels distant,<br>
                    My thoughts out of place.<br><br>
                    
                    But I’ve made it this far,<br>
                    That alone is proof—<br>
                    Anyone can be a star<br>
                    When they fight for their truth.<br>

                    You are someone.<br>
                    You matter more than you think.<br><br>

                    Look at how far you’ve come—<br>
                    and how much further you still can go.<br><br>

                    There is more waiting for you than what hurts right now.<br>
                    People care about you, even from a distance.<br><br>
                
                    You don’t have to carry everything alone—<br>
                    you just have to let someone know when you need them.<br>
