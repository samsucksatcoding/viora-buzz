<h1>🧠 THE BRAIN CELL MUSEUM 🧠</h1>
<p>Welcome to a curated exhibit of all known surviving brain cells.</p>

<p>Originally belonged to someone who said “I’ll only play one more round.”</p>
</div>

<div class="cell">
<h2>Brain Cell #2</h2>
<p>This one left in 2013 and has not been seen since. Last known message: “brb.”</p>
</div>

<div class="cell">
<h2>Brain Cell #3</h2>
<p>Found crying behind a couch because someone tried to do math without a calculator.</p>
