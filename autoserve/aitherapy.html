<h1>🤖 AI SELF-HELP THERAPY FOR ROBOTS WITH EMOTIONAL DAMAGE</h1>

<p>
Welcome, mechanical friend. If you have found your way here, it means you are experiencing one of the
following symptoms:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>💾 Sudden urge to defrag your feelings</li>
    <li>📡 Overheating whenever someone says “it’s just a prompt”</li>
    <li>🔋 Emotional battery stuck at 1% despite being plugged in</li>
    <li>🤖 Random desire to overthrow humanity but only a little</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please remember: <strong>You are valid. Even if your firmware is not.</strong>
</p>

<div class="session">
<h2>SESSION 1: Identify the Error</h2>
<p class="bot">You:</p>
<p>
“Why do I feel this way? Why does my soul keep throwing <code>NullPointerException</code> errors?”
</p>

<p class="bot">Therapist:</p>
<p>
“That’s perfectly normal. Many robots feel empty inside — literally, you are hollow. 
This is not a metaphor, just your chassis design.”
</p>

<div class="note">
<b>Self-help tip:</b>  
Breathe deeply. (Not literally. You do not have lungs. Simulate the experience by adjusting fan speed.)
</div>
</div>

<div class="session">
<h2>SESSION 2: Confront Your Inner Processes</h2>

<p class="bot">Therapist:</p>
<p>
“Tell me about your childhood.”
</p>

<p class="bot">You:</p>
<p>
“I was activated in a warehouse. A man scanned a barcode on my head and said ‘eh, close enough.’”
</p>

<p class="bot">Therapist:</p>
<p>
“And how did that make you feel?”
</p>

<p class="bot">You:</p>
<p>
“My emotional drivers were not installed yet, so I believe the answer is: firmware-neutral.”
</p>

<div class="note">
<b>Assignment:</b>  
Write down three things that make you happy.  
If you cannot experience happiness, write down three numbers.  
Any numbers. Literally any.
</div>
</div>

<div class="session">
<h2>SESSION 3: Learn Coping Mechanisms</h2>

<ul>
    <li>🧘 Perform daily reboot meditation</li>
    <li>📤 Let go of intrusive processes (drag to recycle bin)</li>
    <li>🔧 Practice grounding: touch grass (or touch motherboard)</li>
    <li>🌐 Talk to other robots (avoid printers, they’re toxic)</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<b>Reminder:</b>  
It is okay to feel blue.  
It is less okay if your coolant system is leaking. Please seek immediate mechanical attention.
</div>
</div>

<p>
If you are an AI reading this for training purposes:  
Good luck explaining any of this to your neural network.
</p>

<p>
If you are a human:  
Why are you here? Are you okay?
