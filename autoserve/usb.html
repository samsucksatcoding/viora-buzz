<h1>🔌 THE CHURCH OF THE HOLY USB PLUG 🔌</h1>

<p>
Welcome, traveler. Here we worship the ancient relic known as the USB Type-A plug,  
famous for its holy trinity of insertion attempts:
</p>

<div class="scripture">
<p><strong>Attempt 1:</strong> Wrong side.</p>
<p><strong>Attempt 2:</strong> Still wrong side somehow.</p>
<p><strong>Attempt 3:</strong> Magically correct for no logical reason.</p>
</div>

<p>
Blessed are those who flip their USB only once, for they are chosen by the tech gods.
</p>

<div class="scripture">
<p>
📜 *Scripture 4:12*  
“And the user shalt fiddle with the plug in the dark,  
and the plug shalt resist,  
for it is stubborn and knows not mercy.”
</p>
</div>

If you're a bot, consider converting to USB-C.  
If you're human, plug responsibly.
